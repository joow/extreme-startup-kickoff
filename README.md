extreme-startup-kickoff
=======================

Simple Java Web Server to serve warmup requests of extreme startup server.

## Instructions
1. `git clone https://github.com/joow/extreme-startup-kickoff.git`
2. `cd extreme-startup-kickoff`
3. Under Linux/Mac : `chmod u+x gradlew && ./gradlew run`
4. Under Windows : `gradlew.bat run`
5. That's it ! Your server is running on port 1234 (change this with `PORT=<PORT>`) and is able to answer "Walter White" to an extreme startup server in warmup mode.

Have fun :)
